This repository contains my practice notebooks and scripts focused on mastering data manipulation and analysis with Pandas, the premier data analysis library in Python. I believe that proficiency in data wrangling‚Äîcleaning, transforming, and preparing data‚Äîis a non-negotiable skill for any work in machine learning and AI.

The files here document my hands-on practice with the core functionalities of Pandas, from reading data files to performing complex aggregations.

## üéØ Core Data Analysis Skills Covered

This collection demonstrates my practical experience with the most important features of the Pandas library, including:

-   **Core Data Structures:**
    -   Creating and working with `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.
-   **Data I/O:**
    -   Reading from and writing to various file formats, primarily CSV.
-   **Data Selection & Filtering:**
    -   Using `loc` and `iloc` for precise data access.
    -   Applying boolean indexing to filter data based on conditions.
-   **Data Cleaning:**
    -   Techniques for handling missing data (`.dropna()`, `.fillna()`).
    -   Dropping or modifying irrelevant columns.
-   **Grouping & Aggregation:**
    -   Using the powerful `groupby()` method to split, apply functions, and combine data.
    -   Calculating aggregate statistics for different data segments.
-   **Merging & Joining:**
    -   Combining multiple DataFrames using `merge` and `join` operations.

## üìö My Learning Pathway

This repository is a core component of my self-directed curriculum for becoming proficient in the entire data science stack.

-   **Step 1:** Python Foundations
-   ‚û°Ô∏è **Step 2: Data Analysis with `Pandas` & `NumPy` (You are here)**
-   **Step 3:** Data Visualization with `Matplotlib`
-   **Step 4:** Computer Vision with `OpenCV`
